# hello-world
This is the beginning of learning how to use github
First step : Create repository
  A single repository is to organize a single project
  Can store anything from folders, files, images etc. Anything a project needs
Second step: Create branch
  Master is the main production branch
  Features are branches, work can be done on this branch before being merged
  Bug fixes and featuer work are separate from main branch so work can be done independently
